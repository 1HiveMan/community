Maker makes decisions in two ways. 

Voting using the Maker Protocol's on-chain governance system. 

And off-chain, engaging with the community and other stakeholders in places like the forums and the public governance calls. 

The Interim Governance Facilitator is currently tasked with several administrative duties that keep the larger community organized, 
proactive, aware, and ready to make decisions.
