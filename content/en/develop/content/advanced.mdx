# Advanced

We finished our intermediate tutorial with the `<Box>` - a basic element that behaves like an html 
`<div>` and allows us to have many new lines, a.k.a. **children**, behave like one child when rendered as 
a React component. Now it's time to see the advantage of this pattern when creating more complicated, visual 
components which you could not dream of in normal md.

## Touts

We've covered CTAs, which are just good-looking green boxes; we've covered Callouts, which can be boxes 
of various different colours which also include an icon; and we've covered images. So what happens when we 
want a good-coloured box, with a nice image to end off our page, direct people to where they need to go next 
or just generally add that extra little touch to our content? Enter the tout...

```md:title=tout.mdx
<Tout image>

<Box>

## Say hi!

</Box>

</Tout>
```

This is the whole shibang. We're passing in properties like `image` to get the preset brand image to appear 
at the bottom of the tout, and you can choose another property `alt` to get the tout to change colour from our 
primary to alternative brand colour. All of these colours can of course be controlled and changed in 
[src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js](https://github.com/makerdao/community-portal/blob/r2d/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js). 
All of the above renders like this: 

<Tout image>

<Box>

Of course, you don't have to include the `image` or the `alt` tags - touts are really flexible like that. 
If you just want a box - similar to CTAs but with flexible colouring, or similar to Callouts, but without the 
spacing necessary for icons - then you can go right ahead:

```md:title=simple-touts.mdx
<Tout>

# Hiya

</Tout>

<Tout alt>

Hello World

</Tout>

<Tout color="red">

Hello World

</Tout>


<Tout stroke>

# Hello World ?

</Tout>

<Tout alt stroke>

# Hello World ?

</Tout>

<Tout alt stroke color="red">

# Hello World ?

</Tout>

<Tout fade>

# Hello World ?

</Tout>

<Tout fade color="black">

# Hello World ?

</Tout>
```

Which ends up rendering like this:

<Tout>

# Hiya

</Tout>

<Tout alt>

Hello World

</Tout>

<Tout color="red">

Hello World

</Tout>


<Tout stroke>

# Hello World

</Tout>

<Tout alt stroke>

# Hello World

</Tout>

<Tout alt stroke color="red">

# Hello World

</Tout>

<Tout fade>

# Hello World

</Tout>

<Tout fade alt stroke>

# Hello World ?

</Tout>

<Tout fade color="black">

# Hello World ?

</Tout>

Here you can see how we're combining multiple different kinds of props to get different results. The sky 
really is the limit once you understand how to compose your props in mdx to give you what you need. If you're 
struggling to remember all the different kinds of components and the properties they offer, just head on over 
to our cheatsheet.

What makes this component advanced is implied in the final tout, which has props: `fade colour="black"`. You'll 
see that the text renders as white, without us doing anything about it. How is that possible?! Through something 
called **HexLuminance**. Basically, we automatically detect how dark the background is and, based on the W3C 
standards, choose whether to render dark or light text. :mind_blown:

> NOTE: Based on the prop (stroke/fade) the HexLuminance check changes. This is because stroke doesn't have a 
background and fades do, but in both cases a color prop can be provided.

## Returning to images

When we first showed you how to use images in the basic tutorial, we did not add any props. Thus, there was a 
slight visual issue with the bottom margin, and the image is always left-aligned. Now it's time to fix that. 
Images on the web are a whole rabbit hole, and Gatsby uses a specific plugin - `gatsby-remark-images` - to process 
and load things extra quickly. Unfortunately, this means it wraps our images and we don't really want to hack around 
in that to get center-alignment or any of the other good things our designers desire. So, we have a wrapper component of 
our own called `<Aligner>`.

The reason we're only introducing it now is because using it requires understanding a few things about DAI-ui - the 
theme library we're using - and how it can be used to style React components. Without getting too technical, there is 
something called [emulsion css](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop), which allows us to style our components inline by adding another prop called `sx`. Just 
like `mdx` extends `md`, `sx` extends the possible `styles`. The variety of ways in which you can use `sx` is almost endless, 
so check out our cheatsheet for some basic starting points, and then dive into the beauty that is DAI-ui.

```md:title=aligned-image.mdx
<Aligner xCenter sx={{marginBottom: 4}}>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png"/>

</Aligner>
```

Will give us both an image centred in the x-direction, as well as a better margin beneath it:

<Aligner xCenter sx={{marginBottom: 4}}>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png"/>

</Aligner>

We use the prop `xCenter` here, though there are others available to you, listed in the cheatsheet.

You could have specified `sx={{marginBottom: "10px"}}`, but the `4` here indicates a preset from DAI-ui - 
which you can also find in the gatsby-plugin-theme-ui index file - which helps 
ensure that all our margins and padding through the site remain the same, without having to change each individual 
component. So, if you are going to add you own styles, the best practice is to ensure you use the correct preset. 
You can find a list of presents and their associated values on the cheat sheet page too.

Let's introduce one more component to see all the crazy things we can do with `sx` and DAI-ui...

## InfoBlocks

The InfoBlock is a somewhat peculiar component in our specs, because the designs called for many different 
kinds, with different styles. So, we implemented a bare-bones version and will show you here how to apply advanced 
mdx styles of your own, depending on your needs.

Info Blocks have 3 states:

1. Image on the Left

```md:title=left-image-infoblock.mdx
<InfoBlock>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png"/>

# Say hi!

The best place to start is in our chat. Say hello and get to know us.

<Link icon="rocketchat">Community chat</Link>


</InfoBlock>
```

<InfoBlock>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png"/>

# Say hi!

The best place to start is in our chat. Say hello and get to know us.

<Link icon="rocketchat">Community chat</Link>


</InfoBlock>

2. Image on the Right

```md:title=right-image-infoblock.mdx
<InfoBlock>

# Say hi!

The best place to start is in our chat. Say hello and get to know us.

<Link icon="rocketchat" to="https://chat.makerdao.com">Community chat</Link>

![InfoBlock](../../../images/infoblock_test.png)

</InfoBlock>
```

<InfoBlock>

# Say hi!

The best place to start is in our chat. Say hello and get to know us.

<Link icon="rocketchat" to="https://chat.makerdao.com">Community chat</Link>

![InfoBlock](../../../images/infoblock_test.png)

</InfoBlock>

> If you put the image first (whether as a React component or as a normal 
md image), it will appear on the left, and if you put it last, it will appear on the right.

3. No Image priority at all (no Image First OR Last in mdx)

```md:title=no-image-infoblock.mdx
<InfoBlock sx={{color: 'onPrimary', background: 'url(https://media3.giphy.com/headers/sazanimation/QGsbVkvFm2uM.gif)'}}>

Hello World :)

![Starfox](../../../images/starfox.png)

Good luck!

</InfoBlock>
```

<InfoBlock sx={{color: 'onPrimary', background: 'url(https://media3.giphy.com/headers/sazanimation/QGsbVkvFm2uM.gif)'}}>

Hello World :)

![Starfox](../../../images/starfox.png)

Good luck!

</InfoBlock>

To get the Alternative Header style, just apply the `alt` Prop like so:

```md:title=alt-infoblock.mdx
<InfoBlock alt>

You'll notice that we passed a gif as a background image into the InfoBlock with no preference on the order 
of the image. Yeah, it doesn't look great and you probably won't ever need to do anything that outlandish, but 
it does illustrate a critical point. **You can add whatever style you like to your components**. You actually 
have **complete control as a content creator** over how your content appears, without ever needing a nerdy developer 
to come and insert stuff for you. Congratulations, you are now a junior front-end developer!
