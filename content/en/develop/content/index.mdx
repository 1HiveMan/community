# Crafting Technical Content

This section is not about writing - the Writing Guide in our Learn section will teach you everything 
you need to know about our style, tone, and other content tricks. This section is all about how to 
add automagic, ready-made React components to your files so that they really pop. We'll start with the basics: 
buttons, Calls to Action (CTAs), images, headers etc. and gradually progress to passing your own props to 
some of the more advanced components this site offers, all while remaining in a familiar markdown file.

Writing markdown which renders responsive React components is a superpower. We hope you'll use it responsibly.
