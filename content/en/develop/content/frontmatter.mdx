# Frontmatter

Frontmatter is the stuff you put at the very top of your markdown files to control everything from the title, page description, 
images, and SEO. On this site, we also use it to control what appears in the gloabl header navigation, as well as how the sidebar 
gets rendered in each section. It's therefore quite important to know how to structure your frontmatter so that your file appears 
in the place you want it to.

## Title

```md:title=title-example.mdx
title[String] - Display title used for Header,Sidenav, and SEO.  
title: Frontmatter
```
<CTA warning>

    **The Title Rule**  

    <Box>

        This specifies that we read and display the title in the frontmatter first, then the first h1 in the file,
        then we fall back to the name of the file. The Title Rule applies globally.

    </Box>

</CTA>

## Order

```md:title=order-example.mdx
order[Integer] - The order in which this file is displayed on the sidenav.
order: 0
```
<CTA warning>

    ** Ordering ** 

    <Box>

        Order in the sidenav is based on lowest number (TOP) to highest (BOTTOM). Files that don't have an order are applied AFTER files that 
        have order in alphabetical order. If this file isn't rendered on the sidenav (ie. Top section files) this won't matter.

    </Box>
</CTA>

## Language Selector 

```md:title=language-example.mdx
hideLanguageSelector[Boolean] - Language selectors render by default, setting this to true for your page allows you to hide it. 
hideLanguageSelector: false
```

## Header Navigation

```md:title=header-example.mdx
header[String] -  Whether this File should be rendered in the Header Navigation.
header: true
  
headerOrder[Integer] - The order in which this file will be displayed on the header. 
headerOrder: 0
```
<CTA warning>

    The header options are an easy way of adding internal files to the global header. Files specified in header.mdx gets applied AFTER these. 
    Files are organised in the header based on lowest number (LEFT) to highest (RIGHT). "Home" is ALWAYS first, then files with headerOrder, 
    then links in header.mdx.

</CTA>

## SEO

**NOTE: "title" is used for the title meta attribute. Title rule still applies.**

```md:title=image-example.mdx
featuredImage[String] - Image to use when a link is shared (ie. Twitter/Facebook)
featuredImage: "../images/test.png"
```

<CTA warning>

    Image must be a path to the images in content/images/

</CTA>

```md:title=keywords-example.mdx
keywords[String] - Comma seperated keywords used for SEO
keywords: "cool, sweet, awesome"
```

```md:title=description-example.mdx
description[String] - Description of this page for SEO.
description: "The most complete guide to writing frontmatter in mdx files that you've ever read."
```

<CTA warning>

    "description" can ALSO used for the excerpt that gets rendered and indexed for searching articles on the site.
