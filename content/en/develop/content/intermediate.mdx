# Intermediate

Our Basic guide showed how Callouts and CTAs require each piece of content to start on a new line. 
This is because each new mdx line is interpreted as a new **child** when it is passed to the magic box which 
turns it into a React component. This means, when using more advanced components, you'll need to be aware not 
just of the props you're specifying in the actual tag, like `primaryOutline` or `icon`, but also the order 
in which you write the content in each component and **leaving new lines between each separate piece**.

<Aligner xCenter sx={{marginBottom: 3}}>

<Image src="../../../images/children.jpg"/>

</Aligner>

## Lists

The list component is an example of why mdx having an opinion in how it renders components works 
in our favor. With mdx, we can order our children consistently. 
This allows us to create smart hooks for rendering each element, which is a fancy way of saying that 
we can create really beautiful lists with more functionality and visual pizzaz than you could ever 
dream of having in normal md files. Let's dive right in.

The rule is **scripting and composition come FIRST**, which just means that you can use the list component 
in the same way you'd write lists normally. Generally we write lists beginning with a hyphen in md. You can use the hyphen, 
or not, when writing content in our `List` component - either way it will render the same thing:

```md:title=basic-list.mdx
<List>

- Hello world

</List> 

<List>

Hello World

</List>
```
Both end up looking like this:


If you want a list element with sub content, that's easy enough to organise:

```md:title=subcontent-list.mdx
<List>

- Element Header
   - Sub content

</List>
```

Which renders like this:


For more complex sub content, we recommend using a Box:


Want to render a few links? Easy! It's important to see, however, that 
these are links that are only in content, and not a Link Element (see more on this below).

```md:title=list-of-links.mdx
<List>
 
<Link to="/">Writing style guide →</Link>

<Link to="/">Visual style guide →</Link>

<Link to="/">Code style guide →</Link>

</List>
```

Which ends up looking like this:



<CTA>

NOTE: Mind the gap! There should be a gap between list elements that will be on the same level 
or mdx will not recognize them as seperate elements.

</CTA>

It's possible to have an entire list element be a link in 2 ways.

1. Providing a Link as a list element
2. Providing a Link component for the first element of our List

```md:title=list-as-link.mdx
<List>

- [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com)


- [Learn] (/learn)

</List>

or

<List>

- <Link to="https://makerdao.com">Maker Dao Website</Link>


- <Link to="/learn">Learn</Link>

</List>
```
<CTA>

NOTE: Mind the even bigger gap! There should be 2 new lines between each link as a list item 
otherwise mdx will only render the first item in your list and nothing else!

</CTA>

Which both end up looking like this:


These links are also capable of having subcontent as well:


If all this isn't enough to blow your hair back, there's some extra flair:

1. If the link is external, the arrow icon will point up-right to mimic the design language of other external links on the website.
2. If you hover over the elements I added some minor juice to make the arrows move.

### Differences between Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists

There are none at the moment. The List component recognizes each type and renders 
them the same. Check out [this PR](https://github.com/makerdao/community-portal/pull/45) for further 
examples of all the crazy things you can put in our list component and to deepend your understanding 
and appreciation of children.

We also DO NOT want to replace the expected behavior of how unordered lists and ordered lists 
written outside of the context of the list component or its sub-content.

## Accordion

So you want to make a list, but with a lot of content, and you don't want to take up a lot of space 
on the page? Sounds like you need a collapsible accordion menu... The Accordion component is ultra simple and 
scripting works with the same Child Rule. Except this time:

1. The first child that appears is the header of the accordion.
2. Everything AFTER the first child will be included in the collapsable content.

```md:title=accordion.mdx
<Accordion>

## Hello World

Some other content

</Accordion>

<Accordion>

## Am I eligible to receive a micro-grant if Maker and Dai are only one part of my agenda?

Some other content inside of an accordion!

> CTA content inside of Accordion

![Starfox](../../../images/starfox.png)

### Let's see how this works?

</Accordion>

<Accordion>

## Some other content inside of an accordion!

### Let's see how this works? 

</Accordion>

<Accordion openIcon="dai" closeIcon="maker">

Of course, it's also possible to have your own icons for opening and closing

</Accordion>

<Accordion defaultOpen>

And you can control whether the menu defaults to being open or closed...

This content will show by default now.

</Accordion>
```

## Checklist

This is another simple component meant to be more visually engaging. It is **not** interactive - it's 
just meant to organise content in a specific way, mostly for guide pages like preparing for hackathons etc. 
Like all the above, it too follows the Child Rule.

```md:title=checkbox.mdx
<Checklist>

We can put **anything** inside this component

> How about a CTA?

<StatusBanner notice>

Or a Status Banner...

</StatusBanner>

<Image src="../../../images/starfox.png" />

#### Now we're talking!

</Checklist>
```

```

## Process Stepper

The process stepper is a carbon copy of the list component, except shaved down to ignore the Link requirements. 
This means the same mindset of scripting a process element is in place. The children dictate the content, 
and how the children are seperated determine each step in the process.

```md:title=process-stepper.mdx
<Process>

### Child 1

Child 2 

<Box>

### Child 3

Bunches and bunches of content can go in here. Anything you like, tbh.

</Box>

<Box>

### Child 4

> Even CTAs

</Box>

</Process>
```

## Box

You'll notice that we've begun wrapping our children in boxes. This is the way to overcome the child rule 
and sneak in more content to one specific child should the need arise. If you wrap your multi-line content 
into a `<Box>`, then this will be read and rendered as a single child. You can already see how useful this 
is in the context of complex lists or process steppers, and it will become more apparent with other, more visual 
components like Touts.

Basically, a `<Box>` is just the old html `<div>` element updated for this brave new world we'll be building together. 
Now it's time to head over to the Advanced tutorial and begin understanding our visual components and how to style everything.

## Column

The column is a great example of where it is almost always necessary to wrap your children in boxes. Our specs 
called for a "2 Column Comparison component" but we developers must implement every edge case including when there's only 1 element.

This component follows the same principle as other advanced components in that each child is it's own column element. 

```md:title=columns.mdx
<Column>

Hello World

</Column>


<Column>

<Box>

- Tools that directly benefit Dai users
- Tools that increase Dai adoption
- Tools that increase access to personal liquidity.

</Box>

- A Heading
    - Tools that directly benefit Dai users
    - Tools that increase Dai adoption
    - Tools that increase access to personal liquidity.

</Column>
```

<Column>

Hello World

</Column>


<Column>

<Box>

- Tools that directly benefit Dai users
- Tools that increase Dai adoption
- Tools that increase access to personal liquidity.

</Box>

- A Heading
    - Tools that directly benefit Dai users
    - Tools that increase Dai adoption
    - Tools that increase access to personal liquidity.

</Column>

> MIND THE GAPS: If there's only 1 new line between "-" element it will count them 
as part of the same UL instead of as seperate children.

There is a unique case: if you want a column with a header, follow this pattern:

```md:title=columns-headers.mdx
<Column>

- ## What we fund
	- <Box>

		- Tools that directly benefit Dai users
		- Tools that increase Dai adoption
		- Tools that increase access to personal liquidity.

	  </Box>


- ## What we don't fund
	- <Box>

		- Pure R&D
		- Information gathering 
		- Additional runway
		- Ethereum ecosystem improvements
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		We also do not allocate grants that contain large marketing budgets and/or Dai giveaways and airdrops.

	  </Box>


</Column>
```
