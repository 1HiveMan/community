# Individual Contributions and Projects

Got an idea and the gumption to improve the MakerDAO community? Community Development can provide up to 5,000 Dai to help make it happen. In order to fund self-directed projects we have a useful framework called Community Development Initiative Proposal (CDIP).

A CDIP is the scoping and framing tool for anyone interested in receiving funds for proposing new MakerDAO community initiatives or resources.
