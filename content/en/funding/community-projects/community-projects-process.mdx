# CDIP Process

Here’s an outline of how self-directed projects move from *idea* to *approval* to *completed*. We've added some helpful resources to get you started.

At a high level, below is a visual representation of the current process.

- Green: proposal owner
- Purple: approving group
- Orange: both

## Roles

There are a number of roles involved in growing a community project from idea to reality:

- **Proposal Owner**: Creator of the proposal and the driver of the project. Sets all contributor roles, goals, timelines, and expectations. Can lead meetings or communications.
- **Contributing Team**: Contributes responsibilities or expertise to the owner, or lead.
- **Advisor**: Supportive role that can help scope, follow up, brainstorm, test, and keep Community Development abreast of communications and project updates.
- **Approving Group**: Evaluators reviewing and approving proposals – a mix of Maker Foundation employees and seasoned contributors of the community.

## Process

## Write Your Proposal Using Our Template.

A proposal should combine suggested ideas (and skills) with the shared goal of improving the resources for the MakerDAO community.

Use this Google Doc template to help structure a proposal so that information is clear and milestones are defined.

## Post Your Proposal in Our Chat.

Post your proposal in our <Link to="https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development">Community-Development chat</Link>. 

</Box>

<Box>

## Engage with Feedback.

An Advisor will reach out to help you through next steps.

The Approving Group will reach out to the proposal owner and provide feedback. You’ll work on scoping, costs, resources and timeline.

</Box>
 
<Box>

## Wait for a Decision.

An Approving Group meets weekly to review proposals and will be in touch for regular updates.

The Approving Group discusses which proposals will get funding and which need more clarification. We’ll reach out to any proposal owners with comments and next steps.

</Box>

<Box>

## Start Work

If it’s a small or medium scoped project and you’ve addressed any feedback, work can then begin.

If it’s a large project, a proposal will need to be split into GitHub issues/tasks and another call with the approving group will be needed to confirm costs and resources.

</Box>

<Box>

## Communicate Progress
The project will have checkpoints and you will be expected to present progress at Community weekly syncs.

</Box>

<Box>

## Evaluate at a Retrospective
Once the work is done, there’ll be a review and retrospective to show off the work, discuss what went well and what can be improved.

</Box>

</List>

## Proposal Details

You should outline anything you need in your proposal. For example:

- People support (developer, designer, editor, writer, videographer, etc.)
- Foundation resources support (brand assets, official product screenshots, etc.)

If you need more resources than anticipated, let your advisor know! They will coordinate a meeting, outline the required resources, and present them to the approving group. They’ll figure out whether to approve additional resources or not.


## What CDIP Committee Looks For

- Clear scope, milestones, timeline, and path to delivery
- 3 months or less scope
- 5K or less
- Clear impact on community growth, team, operations improvements, or workflow improvements
- some research complete upfront to assist the clarity of the plan


## Current CDIP Decision Process

- Advisor meeting complete and table on second page complete
- Committee meets to determine if the impact is clear and the ROI is defined. 
- Feedback is shared if not approved and next steps for approval.
- Improvements shared and check ins scheduled if approved.
- Advisor adds status updates and tags github issue.


## Quick Heuristics and Evaluative Questions

- A simple set of deliverables (one or two items, a presentation, an MVP of a technical product) on a realistic timeline is best. 
- Amount of billing is clear upfront. Think defined number for set hours, try to avoid ranges.
- Does contributor have a portfolio to cross reference or demonstrate skills relevant to CDIP?
- Are the plans are expedient? 

## Possible Blockers (and possible route to help or why it's a blocker )

- Over 3 months timeline (maybe CDIP is a grant)
- More than five hours or research is necessary to complete the idea phase (idea probably not clear enough)
- Too many web3 interactions or protocol dependencies (possibly a hackathon is a better format)
