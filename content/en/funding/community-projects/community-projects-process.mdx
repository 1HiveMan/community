# Community projects process

## Roles

There are a number of roles involved in a community project:

- **Proposal owner**: Creator of the CDIP and the driver of the project. Sets all contributor roles, goals, timelines, and expectations. Can lead meetings or communications.
- **Contributing Team**: Contributes responsibilities or expertise to the owner, or lead.
- **Advisor**: Supportive role that can help scope, follow up, brainstorm, test, and keep Community Development abreast of communications and project updates.
- **Approving Group**: Evaluator\(s\) reviewing and approving proposals – a mix of Maker Foundation employees and seasoned contributors of the community.

## Workflow

Below is a visual representation of our current process.

- Green: proposal owner
- Purple: approving group
- Orange: both

<Process>

<Box>

## 1. Submit your proposal
To submit a proposal follow <Link to="/funding/community-projects/index">these instructions</Link>

</Box>

<Box>

## 2. Wait for feedback
The approving group will reach out to the proposal owner and provide feedback. You’ll work on scoping, costs, resources and timeline.

</Box>
 
<Box>

## 3. Wait for a decision
The approving group meets to discuss which proposals will get funding and which need more clarification. We’ll reach out to any proposal owners with comments and next steps.

</Box>

<Box>

## 4. Start work
If it’s a small or medium scoped project and you’ve addressed any feedback, work can then begin.
If it’s a large project, a proposal will need to be split into GitHub issues/tasks and another call with the approving group will be needed to confirm costs and resources.

</Box>

<Box>

## 5. Communicate progress
The project will have checkpoints and you will be expected to present progress at Community weekly syncs.

</Box>

<Box>

## 6. Evaluate at a retrospective
Once the work is done, there’ll be a review and retrospective to show off the work, discuss what went well and what can be improved.

</Box>

</Process>

## Resources

You should outline anything you need in your proposal. For example:

- People support \(developer, designer, editor, writer, videographer, etc\)
- Foundation resources support \(brand assets, official product screenshots, etc\)

If you need more resources than you first thought, let your advisor know. They will coordinate a meeting, outline the required resources, and present them to the approving group. They’ll figure out whether to approve additional resources or not.
