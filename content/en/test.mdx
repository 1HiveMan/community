### Writer  

**Take initial notes, screenshots, and fixes notes in post-editing with 
the availability of the recording.**

We recommend at least two people do this role, splitting up the work for the entire summary. 
Multiple writers have the advantage of supporting each other with formatting, screenshots, and 
quality assurance on sections that they are not taking the initial notes on. 

Writers use the hand emoji during live calls to request help from another writer.
