# Learn Sub Topic Page

## Example: Governance Polls

These sub-topic pages follow the same advice as [Intro page example: Dai guide](./learn-intro.mdx)

This content may be more technical as it's probably a more niche topic however the same content design principles apply.

- Introduce it succinctly
- Explain the topic in logical sections
  - If a topic isn't critical to understanding the sub-topic, leave it out or reference it and provide a link to another page that covers it in detail.
- Link out to related topics and resources
