# Process Page

## Like Use Github

## Page purpose

Walk a user through a process step-by-step so they can either

- achieve it
- understand it for expectation setting

## Page structure

1. Intro the process
2. Explain each step of the proocess
3. Link to other resources that help with the process

## **Page title**

Describe the process you'll be explaining. Example: The translation process

## **Intro**

This intro should situate the user and explain what they can do on this page. Be sure to address the user and explain what they can do here rather than talking from Maker's perspective. Remember you're talking directly to our users. For example:

## Before the process

Before you start writing out the steps, make sure you add anything the user should be aware of first before they start.

![Writing Roles](/content/images/writer reviewer two column.png)

In the example above, it was important the user understood the two roles involved in the note-taking process. This is important pre-reading before understanding the steps involved.

**This space is for anything that helps users understand the steps.**

## The steps

Each step should be either:

- an instruction
  - For example: Forward your .md file to your project coordinator
- an explanation of a stage in the process
  - For example: Writers complete their notes with the recording\

**The step content itself will largely depend on the context. But try and make it easy to follow by addressing the user and explaining what they should do.**

Format steps best on the content needs

- Use bulleted lists to list options

  - for example:

        Once you’ve received the recording you can complete the summary by:

        - adding time-anchored-links

        - adding relevant links

        - fixing unclear or unfinished notes.

        Let the reviewer know once you’re finished with this.

    Use a callout if there are additional tips or warnings about a step in the process
    For example:

![Callout in process](/content/images/process-callout.png)

- Link users out to other relevant resources or explanations where needed.

## Suggested reading

This section is particularly useful if there is additional reading material or resources related to the process. For example the Note-taking template is related to the Note-taking process. Although you've probably linked to that in the steps, it's useful to include a more obvious link in case a user is scanning for this content.

Alternatively this section can be used to:

- direct users to where they can get help – this is a last resort as we want the page to answer their questions. But at least this provides them with a suitable way to get what they want.

**As a general rule of thumb, use this section to expose other pages within the section.**
