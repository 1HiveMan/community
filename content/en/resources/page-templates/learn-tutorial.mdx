# Learn Tutorial

## Guide page like how to participate in voting

Pages like this are designed to be tutorials through a task for beginners. This might be:

- How to get Dai
- How to vote in MakerDAO governance
- How to manage a vault
- How to propose new collateral

This means these pages should incorporate elements from both:

<List>

[Learn Intro Page: Dai](/content/en/resources/page-templates/learn-intro.mdx)

[Process Page](/content/en/resources/page-templates/process-page.mdx)

</List>

After all you'll be talking users through a process (like opening a Vault) while assuming no existing knowledge. So the goal is to both educate and help with task completion.

- Make sure steps in the task are small and easy to follow
- Use this as an opportunity to surface other resources that help with these tasks (like a Vault monitoring product)
- Add links to Chat so that users can ask for help if instructions are unclear
  - Remember to update the page based on their query

## Rich media

Screenshots and videos are likely to be of particular use to support the written content. Note, they should support rather than replace written content for better accessibility.

ðŸ’¡ Product UI/UX changes regularly so including screenshots and videos does mean you'll need to regularly ensure they still accurately portray how to do a task
