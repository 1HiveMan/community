# Working on a Bounty

### Bounties come in many shapes and sizes but there are a few ways to make sure things run smoothly. Here’s the recommended workflow for new contributors.

## The Process

### 1. Work with the Community Team

Most medium to large bounties require collaboration with the Contributing Team. Contributors working on bounties are assigned an Advisor, and in some cases, introduced to other contributors.

Work together to develop a plan that helps structure the approach:

* Clear, attainable goals
* Realistic timelines and deadlines
* The best way to split up any work
* Roles and responsibilities
* Times to sync up

### 3. Work Openly

Start work in a Google Doc so the Contributing Team can collaboratively review and leave feedback. Be sure to communicate regularly with the team and the wider community. It's strongly encouraged to share work, ask for feedback and keep everyone updated in the [community chat](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development)

Keep the GitHub issue attached to your bounty up to date with comments and feedback.



### 4. Submit a Final Draft

<CTA>
<Icon name="search"/> If the work is content-based, it will have to be copied from a Google Doc to markdown. All content on the site is in markdown. Use Hack.md to create markdown content.
</CTA>

When your work is ready for final approval, submit a pull request in GitHub and update the GitHub issue.

[How to use GitHub](/work_with_us/content/how-to-use-github.mdx)

Once a pull request has been approved, the Advisor will let give directions for requesting Dai.



### 5. Help Improve the Process

Once a bounty has been completed, let us know what went well and what didn’t. Suggest any ideas for improvements. This can be done on a call or via [community chat](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development).
