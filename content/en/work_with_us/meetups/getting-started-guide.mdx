## Hosting a meetup

The first steps to organize an event include:

1. Deciding whether the event will be physical or virtual.
2. Creating an [agenda.](event-formats-guide.md)
3. Figuring out the [budget.](budget-guide.md)
4. Determining the time and location of the event. 
   - If the event will be virtual, be sure to find a suitable [platform for hosting.](#virtual-event-platforms)
6. Coordinating resources to record the event.
7. Creating a plan for [promoting](promotion-guide.md) the event.

Once you have your meetup plan ready, speakers confirmed, the venue set, and the event promoted, it's time for the execution.

### The Day of the Event

* Send communications to all the essential parties early in the day.
* Repeat promotional messaging across all relevant channels on the day of the event.
* Read through the [Feedback Form](https://airtable.com/shr6Icuj6tOy0k55l) to get familiar with the various details to keep track of.
* Arrive at the venue early to prepare and test the equipment.
* During the introduction, describe the agenda, introduce the speakers, and talk about the key takeaways participants can expect from the event.
* Be welcoming and informative.

## Feedback Form

To qualify for funding, we require hosts to provide feedback following their event using our [Feedback Form](https://airtable.com/shr6Icuj6tOy0k55l). 

This helps us to better understand the impact of these events and what we can do to help make them better.

Please read through the [Feedback Form](https://airtable.com/shr6Icuj6tOy0k55l) before the event to prepare to answer the questions.

## Best Practices

Organizers have found these to be helpful tips when planning their events.

* Plan on paper before doing anything else.
* Find people willing to help with the event.
* Write a budget and update it as things get locked things in.
* When scouting a location, ask for a breakdown of available equipment.
* Consider the audience and plan the meetup in a way that suits their needs.
* Be the catalyst and facilitator, not the featured speaker at every meeting \(people will get bored.\)
* If hosting a regular event, set a consistent date, time, and location.
* Include information about the speakers on promotional materials.
* Shake up the format! Have presentations, panel discussions, roundtables, workshops, etc.
* Avoid canceling meetups.
