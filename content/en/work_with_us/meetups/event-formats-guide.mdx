# Event Formats

This page contains a list of suggestions for different formats community members can utilize for their events.

The list includes consideration for both virtual and in-person events. We highly encourage organizers to experiment with interesting and engaging formats and to [add their ideas to this guide!](../content/)

## How to Pick a Format

Before planning an event it's important to consider the purpose of the event and who it's intended to serve. 

Is the event for students who've never heard of crypto? Is it for developers looking to gain new skills? Maybe the goal is to help promote local businesses developing decentralized technologies.

Whoever it's for, defining the purpose and audience of the event makes it easier to decide how to structure an event.

## Event Formats

### Academic and Educational

These events focus on the education and spread of ideas through debates, Q&A, workshops, professional panels, etc.

* Presentations
  * Good for deep dives or introductions to various topics and ideas, e.g. Give a presentation called "Ethereum, Commerce, and the Future of Stable Cryptocurrency"

* Debates, Panels, Interviews, Q&A sessions, or Fireside Chats
  * Best for crowds already familiar with the topic
  * Good way to get people to think about current issues and solutions to problems

* Workshops and Demos
  * Good for adding substance to very technical presentations
  * Increasing engagement with attendees will make the event more enjoyable

### Technical

These events educate developers and business professionals on the development of new technologies and applications.

* Developer-focused
  * Presentations
    * Good way to introduce or dig deep into hard topics without interruptions

* Dai Dappy Hour
  * Although we don't fund bar tabs, enabling attendees to purchase food and/or beverages with cryptocurrency can be a fun supplement to an event

* Casual Maker and DeFi Fan meetups
  * Instead of a presentation, these can include demos, round-tables, ice-breakers, etc.
  * Incorporate games, raffles, Dai auctions, or even a donation matching initiative to generate more value for attendees

### Demos and Hands-On Sessions

These events educate people on how they can use Dai and MakerDAO by interacting with basic web3 tools like wallets, exchanges, and dApps.
