## Selecting a Format

Before planning an event it's important to consider the purpose of the event and who it's intended to serve.

Is the event for students who've never heard of crypto? Is it for developers looking to gain new skills? Maybe the goal is to help promote local businesses developing decentralized technologies.

Whoever it's for, defining the purpose and audience of the event makes it easier to decide how to structure the event.
