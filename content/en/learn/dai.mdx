# Dai

Dai is collateral-backed money whose value is pegged to the US Dollar.

The Dai token lives on the Ethereum blockchain. All circulating Dai are generated from [Maker Vaults](vault.mdx) and are backed by a surplus of collateral assets.

## Why Dai?

A decentralized digital economy needs stable money in order to function. Dai is a price-stable asset that can be used as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.

Dai enables a wide range of financial activities and applications that have previously been untenable due to the volatility of legacy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

### Applications

<InfoBlock>

In addition to the [Dai Savings Rate](dsr.md), which enables Dai users to earn accruals on the Dai they save, here is a non-exhaustive list of things Dai can be used for:

<List>

- Hedging: During periods of high market volatility, Dai offers a safe harbor to store value without having to exit the crypto ecosystem.

- Exchange pairs: Crypto-to-crypto trading can be a complicated proposition. It is difficult to track earnings when both sides of a trading pair are rising and falling in value. Creating markets that pair with DAI creates lower risk markets for market makers, and gives regular traders a stable asset to trade against.

- Financial products: Dai can be used as collateral for various types of financial instruments, and can also be accepted for repayment of debt.

- Merchant receipts, cross-border transactions, and remittances: Dai transactions are borderless and settle in minutes compared to legacy cross-border transaction solutions, which often take days or weeks and charge high fees.

- Prediction markets and gambling: Long term betting becomes infeasible if users also have to gamble on the future price of the asset they are wagering. A cryptocurrency with price stability like Dai can be the natural choice for prediction markets or gambling applications.

- Retail and Consumer Use of Cryptocurrency: Use of cryptocurrency in regular day-to-day economic activity can only scale with a stable asset as a medium of exchange. Dai fills this role perfectly.
